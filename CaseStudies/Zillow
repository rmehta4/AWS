-- Use Apache Spark on Amazon EMR

-- Zillow uses Amazon Kinesis Streams to ingest a variety of data, including public-property records, home tax assessments, sales
transactions, images and video, MLS-listing data, and user-provided information. All this data is ingested and pushed into Spark on
Amazon EMR, which runs machine-learning models and gives users near-real-time Zestimates. The same dataset is sent in parallel from 
Amazon Kinesis Streams to Amazon Kinesis Firehose, which batches the data in 15-minute intervals and delivers it to Zillowâ€™s centralized 
data lake on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). From the data lake, a number of applications such as personalization, advertising
optimization,and recommendations use the data without storage scalability concerns.
